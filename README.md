# Shopping

This projects employs a classifier to determine if an online shopper will make a purchase during that session. The nearest-neighbor classifier will analyze several factors including how many pages the shopper has visited, whether or not they are shopping on the weekend, and what web browser they are using to make the determination. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, two measurements, sensitivity and specificity, will be used to score the correctly labeled positive shoppers and shoppers that did not make a purchase.
